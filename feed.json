We own two old-school Segways which we mostly ride for fun. I drive a leased 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E First Edition and love it. Lisa has a 2022 electric Mini Cooper. We really like electric vehicles. Maybe that's because we generate and store our own electricity with 60 solar panels on the roof and two Tesla Powerwall batteries. Our house is on a well and without electricity we have no water. \r\n\r\n\r\n{{< youtube id=\"03FQZti4vxk\" autoplay=\"false\" >}}\r\n\r\n",

				"title": "Time To Ask The Tech Guys",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>As of Sunday, December 18, 2022, the Tech Guy radio show is no more. But starting Sunday, January 8, 2023 a new and improved show will be born: Ask The Tech Guys with Leo and Mikah!</p>\n<p>I may be “retiring from radio” but all that really means is that I’m hanging up the transmitter and towers. I’ll still be talking tech with you for six shows a week at <a href=\"https://twit.tv/atg\">TWiT.tv</a> Most importantly, I’m still doing The Tech Guy show but without all the attendant radio cruft.</p>\n<p>Here’s how the show will differ:</p>\n<p>Mikah Sargent is co-hosting with me. Yay! Mikah represents the next generation of tech guys, and, more importantly to me, we have a lot of fun together!</p>\n<p>We’re going to use the “Living Room” set in the studio with additional demos in “Radio Corner.” (If that’s confusing watch, you’ll see what I mean.)</p>\n<p>No more 19 minutes of radio commercials per hour - seriously, that’s not an exaggeration, that’s the legal max. We’ll still have podcast ads but no more than three per show. Ironically this means the podcast will be longer because we’ve been cutting those radio ads, and local newscasts, etc, out. I anticipate the show will be closer to 3 hours than the previous 2 hours. Of course, there will be only one show a week instead of two, but still a net loss of an hour per weekend from previous years.</p>\n<p>We’ll still stream it live at <a href=\"https://live.twit.tv\">live.twit.tv </a>Sundays 11a-2p Pacific/2-5p Eastern/1900-2200 UTC, and we’re hoping for plenty of live calls. Calls will be primarily via Zoom. We’re strongly encouraging everyone to call from their smart phones using <a href=\"%20https://call.twit.tv\">call.twit.tv</a> - you won’t need to install Zoom. We will also be answering emails at <a href=\"mailto:askthetechguys@twit.tv\">askthetechguys@twit.tv..</a> And encouraging recorded questions via email.</p>\n<p>Expect two hands-on demos a week. We will always offer audio versions of the show, but we want to use the availability of video to do more. We’ll make sure to describe the video for people who only listen.</p>\n<p>Questions and answers will still be the backbone of the show, as before, but we’ll also have several pre-recorded segments every week from the Tech Guy contributors (Scott, Johnny, Dick, Sam, Chris, and Rod) as well as short interview segments. For example, I’m interviewing Daniel Suarez about his new book Critical Mass, on Feb 10. A 10-minute except will be aired on ATG and the full interview will be a Triangulation special. I want to use ATG as a chance to do more short, one-off interviews. We need these short pre-recorded segments of 3-5 minutes to give us a break during the live recording on Sundays.</p>\n<p>In short, the show will be the Tech Guy plus. I’ll still do the show opens, aka my Sunday Sermon, but I think it will feel a bit more relaxed without the clock forcing me to break at awkward moments. We are going to put a time limit on calls and segments, however, to maintain some pace.</p>\n<p>I think it will be a really fun, engaging, and informative show unlike anything we’ve done in the past. I hope you’ll listen.</p>\n<p>The feed is exactly the same, as is the show page: <a href=\"https://twit.tv/ttg\">twit.tv/ttg</a> or <a href=\"https://techguylabs.com\">techguylabs.com</a>. If you’re already subscribed to The Tech Guy feed in your podcast client do nothing. The show will continue with episode 1956.</p>\n<p>See you Sunday!</p>\n<p>UPDATE: Unfortunately, between diminishing ad revenue and a shrinking audience, we've had to close our TWiT studios as of August 2024. Mikah and I are now working from our respective homes, and it's difficult to continue the call-in show. For now, Mikah will continue to answer your questions at the same time every Sunday with <em>Hands On Tech. </em></p>\n",

In a result unsurprising to those who follow this research, they found that higher levels of political knowledge actually deepened the likelihood that conservatives with low trust in people and major institutions would endorse right-wing conspiracy theories. In a section reviewing previous research on the subject, the authors explained that political sophisticates “have the ability to make connections between abstract principles and more concrete attitudes and are therefore more fully able to notice the implications of specific attitudes for their worldviews.” “Because politically knowledgeable people care more about politics and hold stronger political attitudes,” they added, “they are especially likely to want to protect those attitudes.”</blockquote>\n\nThe researchers conclude that \"people will believe what they want to believe in spite of available data and evidence.\" \n\n",

End Daylight Saving Time!\n\nThe august [Academy of Sleep Medicine](https://aasm.org/american-academy-of-sleep-medicine-calls-for-elimination-of-daylight-saving-time/) has finally proclaimed the truth. \n\n<blockquote>The AASM supports a switch to permanent standard time, explaining in the statement that standard time more closely aligns with the daily rhythms of the body’s internal clock. The position statement also cites  evidence of **increased risks of motor vehicle accidents, cardiovascular  events, and mood disturbances following the annual “spring forward” to  daylight saving time**.\n\n“Permanent, year-round standard time is the best choice to most closely match our circadian sleep-wake cycle,” said lead author Dr. M. Adeel Rishi, a pulmonology, sleep medicine and critical care specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and vice chair of the AASM Public Safety Committee. “Daylight saving time results in more darkness in the morning and more light in the evening, disrupting the body’s natural rhythm.”</blockquote>\n\nThe AASM position statement on daylight saving time has been endorsed by the following organizations:\n\n- American Academy of Cardiovascular Sleep Medicine\n- American Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine\n- American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST)\n- American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine\n- California Sleep Society\n- Dakotas Sleep Society\n- Kentucky Sleep Society\n- Maryland Sleep Society\n- Michigan Academy of Sleep Medicine\n- Missouri Sleep Society\n- National PTA\n- National Safety Council\n- Society for Research on Biological Rhythms\n- Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine\n- Society of Behavioral Sleep Medicine\n- Southern Sleep Society\n- Start School Later\n- Tennessee Sleep Society\n- Wisconsin Sleep Society\n- World Sleep Society.\n\nAnd, I’d like to add, by the *Leo Laporte Sleep Society*. \n\nOK President Trump, you want to do something that would ensure your re-election in November? Stop the Insanity! What's the use of being an autocrat if you can't use your power for good!\n",
