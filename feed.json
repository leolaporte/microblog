				"title": "Time To Ask The Tech Guys",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->",
				"content_text": "<p>As of Sunday, December 18, 2022, the Tech Guy radio show is no more. But starting Sunday, January 8, 2023 a new and improved show will be born: Ask The Tech Guys with Leo and Mikah!</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>I may be “retiring from radio” but all that really means is that I’m hanging up the transmitter and towers. I’ll still be talking tech with you for six shows a week at <a href=\"https://twit.tv/atg\">TWiT.tv</a> Most importantly, I’m still doing The Tech Guy show but without all the attendant radio cruft.</p>\n<p>Here’s how the show will differ:</p>\n<p>Mikah Sargent is co-hosting with me. Yay! Mikah represents the next generation of tech guys, and, more importantly to me, we have a lot of fun together!</p>\n<p>We’re going to use the “Living Room” set in the studio with additional demos in “Radio Corner.” (If that’s confusing watch, you’ll see what I mean.)</p>\n<p>No more 19 minutes of radio commercials per hour - seriously, that’s not an exaggeration, that’s the legal max. We’ll still have podcast ads but no more than three per show. Ironically this means the podcast will be longer because we’ve been cutting those radio ads, and local newscasts, etc, out. I anticipate the show will be closer to 3 hours than the previous 2 hours. Of course, there will be only one show a week instead of two, but still a net loss of an hour per weekend from previous years.</p>\n<p>We’ll still stream it live at <a href=\"https://live.twit.tv\">live.twit.tv </a>Sundays 11a-2p Pacific/2-5p Eastern/1900-2200 UTC, and we’re hoping for plenty of live calls. Calls will be primarily via Zoom. We’re strongly encouraging everyone to call from their smart phones using <a href=\"%20https://call.twit.tv\">call.twit.tv</a> - you won’t need to install Zoom. We will also be answering emails at <a href=\"mailto:askthetechguys@twit.tv\">askthetechguys@twit.tv..</a> And encouraging recorded questions via email.</p>\n<p>Expect two hands-on demos a week. We will always offer audio versions of the show, but we want to use the availability of video to do more. We’ll make sure to describe the video for people who only listen.</p>\n<p>Questions and answers will still be the backbone of the show, as before, but we’ll also have several pre-recorded segments every week from the Tech Guy contributors (Scott, Johnny, Dick, Sam, Chris, and Rod) as well as short interview segments. For example, I’m interviewing Daniel Suarez about his new book Critical Mass, on Feb 10. A 10-minute except will be aired on ATG and the full interview will be a Triangulation special. I want to use ATG as a chance to do more short, one-off interviews. We need these short pre-recorded segments of 3-5 minutes to give us a break during the live recording on Sundays.</p>\n<p>In short, the show will be the Tech Guy plus. I’ll still do the show opens, aka my Sunday Sermon, but I think it will feel a bit more relaxed without the clock forcing me to break at awkward moments. We are going to put a time limit on calls and segments, however, to maintain some pace.</p>\n<p>I think it will be a really fun, engaging, and informative show unlike anything we’ve done in the past. I hope you’ll listen.</p>\n<p>The feed is exactly the same, as is the show page: <a href=\"https://twit.tv/ttg\">twit.tv/ttg</a> or <a href=\"https://techguylabs.com\">techguylabs.com</a>. If you’re already subscribed to The Tech Guy feed in your podcast client do nothing. The show will continue with episode 1956.</p>\n<p>See you Sunday!</p>\n<p>UPDATE: Unfortunately, between diminishing ad revenue and a shrinking audience, we've had to close our TWiT studios as of August 2024. Mikah and I are now working from our respective homes, and it's difficult to continue the call-in show. For now, Mikah will continue to answer your questions at the same time every Sunday with <em>Hands On Tech. </em></p>\n",

In a result unsurprising to those who follow this research, they found that higher levels of political knowledge actually deepened the likelihood that conservatives with low trust in people and major institutions would endorse right-wing conspiracy theories. In a section reviewing previous research on the subject, the authors explained that political sophisticates “have the ability to make connections between abstract principles and more concrete attitudes and are therefore more fully able to notice the implications of specific attitudes for their worldviews.” “Because politically knowledgeable people care more about politics and hold stronger political attitudes,” they added, “they are especially likely to want to protect those attitudes.”</blockquote>\n\nThe researchers conclude that \"people will believe what they want to believe in spite of available data and evidence.\" \n\n",

				"title": "How To Be \"Talent\"",
				"content_html": "<p>One of our hosts asked me for some talent coaching. This is how I responded.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I’ll tell you what I do, but this is only what works for me. I don’t have any talent. I can&rsquo;t tell jokes. I can’t juggle. I&rsquo;m not sexy. So all I can do is try to be myself, be likable, and serve my audience. I’m always trying to get to the love that’s at the core of all human interactions. For me, connecting with the audience is to love and honor who they are. And connecting with the audience is my job. It’s what I strive to do every time I’m on the air.</p>\n<p>I do very little prep these days - I should definitely do more but I’m lazy. Remember I’ve been on the radio for 43 years, and doing interviews since 1987, so everything I do is totally internalized and mostly unconscious. There’s no way I could pass it on to you, and you wouldn’t want me to if I could, since the essence of being good on the air is to be totally yourself. And, bad news, you can’t <em>pursue</em> being centered and authentic on the air. You can only relax into it. And that just takes practice. It took me 15 years before I was any good.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>In interviews, I am naturally curious. That helps. Always pay attention like a hawk to what people are saying. They’ll tell you what they want to talk about. Make it a conversation, not a series of questions. I will sometimes think of a question or two ahead of time, just so I have something to fall back on, but generally, if you are really engaged in the conversation, the next question will come easily. Never be thinking of what you’re going to ask next; you’ll miss the cues your guest is giving you. The essence of great interviewing is to be a great listener. Engage in the conversation and let your natural curiosity direct you. Be very careful about trying to show what you know. I hear a lot of interviewers trying to be smart. It’s better to be dumb. That’s how you learn.</p>\n<p>I think it is worth trying to be as honest and genuine as you can be at all times. People can sniff inauthenticity. There’s plenty of it on the airwaves, but I believe people want to see you as you are. That’s scary because there’s always the risk people won’t like you, but it’s better to be yourself than to try to appeal to people by putting on a false persona. If they don’t like you, so be it.</p>\n<p>Be open, be kind, and always aim toward honesty. It’s hard enough in real life, and it’s even harder on-the-air because you can&rsquo;t see your audience. It’s easy to fall into the trap of being automatic. Always strive to be present and always ask yourself, “am I telling the truth?”</p>\n<p>Studying <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre\">improv</a> was useful. In improv the rule is always to respond to every prompt with &ldquo;yes, and&rdquo; - never block, never say no. In improv you learn to listen. You also learn how to center and relax even while your energy is soaring. When the mic comes on you&rsquo;re going to feel a rush of energy. Use it, don&rsquo;t let it run you. You want to get into a heightened state of awareness without becoming amped up. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi\">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a> calls it flow. You&rsquo;re always working to get into the flow state. Also, learn how to pronounce long last names.</p>\n<p>This is all very meta advice. I don’t do “talent coaching.” Sometimes coaching is as simple as telling someone to say “you know” less, but I don’t like to operate at that level. You should do that yourself. Watch video and look for repetitive verbal crutches and tics. Practice reading until you can be fluent, even the first time you see something. I make little notes to myself about goals, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t interrupt,&rdquo; &ldquo;slow down,&rdquo; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t curse,&rdquo; etc. and then store them in the back of my mind. Practice one thing at a time. It’s good to work on technique, but you don’t want to become self-conscious.</p>\n<p>It’s like learning to be a pro-basketball player. You can work on your skills, and I guess you have to, but nothing is going to sing until you can stop being self-conscious enough to flow. If you’re “working at it” on-the-air it shows. Never let them see you sweat. You don’t want to make your audience worry about you. You want them to feel like you’re supremely confident and in control. But if you’re not, and stuff is falling apart, don’t hide it, be honest. Don’t freak out, enjoy yourself. That’s another way to be in control: own what’s going on. Your audience always knows exactly what’s going on. Don’t cover up, own up.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it all goes to hell. It happens to all of us. Don’t sweat it. Tomorrow is another show. Keep striving to connect with your audience, to be human, to be honest, to be vulnerable. Strip away the protective shell we all wear and be present. The best on-air talent is totally real.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s good to study others and notice what works. I love to study veteran performers. I am always impressed with how calm and in command they are. They never strive to entertain, they just do. Think of the person you like best on the air. What makes them interesting? What makes you <em>like</em> them? Find that in yourself. Don’t be them, of course, be you, but it&rsquo;s normal to start out by imitating your heroes and develop your own style later. I was heavily influenced by David Letterman, and copied his mannerisms for a long time. Before that it was Don Imus. I liked them because they never seemed to be trying to please their audiences. They had a &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; attitude. My career didn&rsquo;t take off until I stopped trying so hard. You don&rsquo;t want to be smarmy or ingratiating. Be cool.</p>\n<p>Always remember you are there to serve your audience. That’s where the humility comes from. They aren&rsquo;t here to listen to you; you are there to serve them. To keep them company. To inform. To entertain. To make their lives better. Even just to give them a little break from the day-to-day. You are performing a great service. Be grateful for the opportunity.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s everything I know about being on-the-air. Now forget what I said and be yourself. Getting to perform for others is a great privilege. Enjoy it.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>Ira Glass from <em>This American Life</em> has the definitive quote: &ldquo;All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile.

This is how I responded. \n<!--more-->\n<!--more-->\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/871/2024/fatherandson.jpg\" alt=\"Leo teaching his baby boy how to broadcast, KSFO 1994\" title=\"FatherandSon.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" />\n\nI’ll tell you what I do, but this is only what works for me. I don’t have any talent. I can't tell jokes. I can’t juggle. I'm not sexy. So all I can do is try to be myself, be likable, and serve my audience. I’m always trying to get to the love that’s at the core of all human interactions. For me, connecting with the audience is to love and honor who they are. And connecting with the audience is my job. It’s what I strive to do every time I’m on the air.\n\nI do very little prep these days - I should definitely do more but I’m lazy. Remember I’ve been on the radio for 43 years, and doing interviews since 1987, so everything I do is totally internalized and mostly unconscious. There’s no way I could pass it on to you, and you wouldn’t want me to if I could, since the essence of being good on the air is to be totally yourself. And, bad news, you can’t _pursue_ being centered and authentic on the air. You can only relax into it. And that just takes practice. It took me 15 years before I was any good.[^1]\n\n[^1]: Ira Glass from _This American Life_ has the definitive quote: \"All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”\n\nIn interviews, I am naturally curious. That helps. Always pay attention like a hawk to what people are saying. They’ll tell you what they want to talk about. Make it a conversation, not a series of questions. I will sometimes think of a question or two ahead of time, just so I have something to fall back on, but generally, if you are really engaged in the conversation, the next question will come easily. Never be thinking of what you’re going to ask next; you’ll miss the cues your guest is giving you. The essence of great interviewing is to be a great listener. Engage in the conversation and let your natural curiosity direct you. Be very careful about trying to show what you know. I hear a lot of interviewers trying to be smart. It’s better to be dumb. That’s how you learn.\n\nI think it is worth trying to be as honest and genuine as you can be at all times. People can sniff inauthenticity. There’s plenty of it on the airwaves, but I believe people want to see you as you are. That’s scary because there’s always the risk people won’t like you, but it’s better to be yourself than to try to appeal to people by putting on a false persona. If they don’t like you, so be it. \n\nBe open, be kind, and always aim toward honesty. It’s hard enough in real life, and it’s even harder on-the-air because you can't see your audience. It’s easy to fall into the trap of being automatic. Always strive to be present and always ask yourself, “am I telling the truth?”\n\nStudying [improv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre) was useful. In improv the rule is always to respond to every prompt with \"yes, and\" - never block, never say no. In improv you learn to listen. You also learn how to center and relax even while your energy is soaring. When the mic comes on you're going to feel a rush of energy. Use it, don't let it run you. You want to get into a heightened state of awareness without becoming amped up. [Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi) calls it flow. You're always working to get into the flow state. Also, learn how to pronounce long last names. \n\nThis is all very meta advice. I don’t do “talent coaching.” Sometimes coaching is as simple as telling someone to say “you know” less, but I don’t like to operate at that level. You should do that yourself. Watch video and look for repetitive verbal crutches and tics. Practice reading until you can be fluent, even the first time you see something. I make little notes to myself about goals, \"don't interrupt,\" \"slow down,\" \"don't curse,\" etc. and then store them in the back of my mind. Practice one thing at a time. It’s good to work on technique, but you don’t want to become self-conscious. \n\nIt’s like learning to be a pro-basketball player. You can work on your skills, and I guess you have to, but nothing is going to sing until you can stop being self-conscious enough to flow. If you’re “working at it” on-the-air it shows. Never let them see you sweat. You don’t want to make your audience worry about you. You want them to feel like you’re supremely confident and in control. But if you’re not, and stuff is falling apart, don’t hide it, be honest. Don’t freak out, enjoy yourself. That’s another way to be in control: own what’s going on. Your audience always knows exactly what’s going on. Don’t cover up, own up.\n\nSometimes it all goes to hell. It happens to all of us. Don’t sweat it. Tomorrow is another show. Keep striving to connect with your audience, to be human, to be honest, to be vulnerable. Strip away the protective shell we all wear and be present. The best on-air talent is totally real. \n\nIt's good to study others and notice what works. I love to study veteran performers. I am always impressed with how calm and in command they are. They never strive to entertain, they just do. Think of the person you like best on the air. What makes them interesting? What makes you _like_ them? Find that in yourself. Don’t be them, of course, be you, but it's normal to start out by imitating your heroes and develop your own style later. I was heavily influenced by David Letterman, and copied his mannerisms for a long time. Before that it was Don Imus. I liked them because they never seemed to be trying to please their audiences. They had a \"take it or leave it\" attitude. My career didn't take off until I stopped trying so hard. You don't want to be smarmy or ingratiating. Be cool. \n\nAlways remember you are there to serve your audience. That’s where the humility comes from. They aren't here to listen to you; you are there to serve them. To keep them company. To inform. To entertain. To make their lives better. Even just to give them a little break from the day-to-day. You are performing a great service. Be grateful for the opportunity. \n\nThat's it. That's everything I know about being on-the-air. Now forget what I said and be yourself. Getting to perform for others is a great privilege. Enjoy it. \n",

[This one](http://paulgraham.com/vb.html), from 2016, truly hits home. \n\nLife is short, so it’s worth eliminating the time wasters. For one, defending yourself online.\n\n<blockquote>Your instinct when attacked is to defend yourself.  But like a lot of instincts, this one wasn't designed for the world we now live in.  Counterintuitive as it feels, it's better most of the time not to defend yourself.  Otherwise these people are literally taking your life.</blockquote>\n\nBut that’s just one of many powerful ideas in this essay. Please take 10 of your precious remaining minutes  to read it. \n\n<blockquote>One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask yourself whether you'll care about it in the future.  Fake stuff that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter.  That's how it tricks you.  The area under the curve is small, but its shape jabs into your consciousness like a pin.</blockquote>\n\nAs I come to the waning years of my life, I want to make every minute count. \n\n<blockquote>Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have.  That's what you do when life is short.</blockquote>\n",

It&rsquo;s effectively a drawstring which helps fit the mask snugly as you tie it.

I tried this using high-threadcount cotton for the outer layer <sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup> and old t-shirts for the inner layer. The t-shirts are soft and comfortable but the pouch opening hits right at the mouth and kind of bothers me. And adding a filter layer (I tried vacuum cleaner bags and paper towels) really reduces breathe-ability. This is key; <strong>if it&rsquo;s not easy to breathe in a mask you won&rsquo;t wear it.</strong></p>\n<p>After reading about research from the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200424081648.htm\">American Chemical Society</a> about the effectiveness of various materials for mask making:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One layer of a tightly woven cotton sheet combined with two layers of  polyester-spandex chiffon &ndash; a sheer fabric often used in evening gowns  &ndash; filtered out the most aerosol particles (80-99%, depending on  particle size), with performance close to that of an N95 mask material.  Substituting the chiffon with natural silk or flannel, or simply using a cotton quilt with cotton-polyester batting, produced similar results.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I decided to eliminate the superfluous filter pouch and replace the t-shirt cotton with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FNDH3EY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">silk charmeuse</a>. It feels better, it&rsquo;s much easier to sew, and the breathe-ability is excellent. Come winter, and yes I expect us to still be wearing masks this winter, I&rsquo;ll replace the silk with flannel.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>To help seal the nose area I use <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NAO56KH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">peel and stick tin ties</a>, the kind used to seal up coffee bags at the grocery store. I experimented with these by ripping them off all our coffee bags, but it turns out you can buy them by the hundred on Amazon, so no more open coffee bags at the Laporte house.</p>\n<p>Sealing the nose well is important for mask effectiveness and to keep my glasses from steaming up. If I&rsquo;m not wearing glasses I&rsquo;m wearing <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LOHONER-Medical-Student-Protective-Anti-Fog/dp/B0868NZ714/ref=sr_1_1?crid=12MUP5K8ER3IS&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=lab+goggles&amp;qid=1591801164&amp;s=home-garden&amp;sprefix=lab+goggl%2Cgarden%2C217&amp;sr=1-1\">protective lab goggles</a>. Keeping the mouth, nose, and eyes protected from aerosolized virus particles is the goal here.</p>\n<p>To soften the edges of the mask and block leaks around the edges, I have started folding all four edges in over a small strip of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F8MRLBG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">cotton quilt batting</a>.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The batting adds some structure and softness to the edges and, as I learned when I used it as a layer in one of my masks, is practically impermeable.

And adding a filter layer (I tried vacuum cleaner bags and paper towels) really reduces breathe-ability. This is key; **if it's not easy to breathe in a mask you won't wear it.** \n\n[^3]: I use quilting fabric from Sewing Arts in Santa Monica. A [fat-quarter bundle](https://sewingarts.com/collections/fat-quarters) can make 40 masks and costs as little as $50. The patterns are really nice, too. \n\nAfter reading about research from the [American Chemical Society](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200424081648.htm) about the effectiveness of various materials for mask making:\n\n> One layer of a tightly woven cotton sheet combined with two layers of  polyester-spandex chiffon -- a sheer fabric often used in evening gowns  -- filtered out the most aerosol particles (80-99%, depending on  particle size), with performance close to that of an N95 mask material.  Substituting the chiffon with natural silk or flannel, or simply using a cotton quilt with cotton-polyester batting, produced similar results. \n\nI decided to eliminate the superfluous filter pouch and replace the t-shirt cotton with [silk charmeuse](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FNDH3EY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). It feels better, it's much easier to sew, and the breathe-ability is excellent. Come winter, and yes I expect us to still be wearing masks this winter, I'll replace the silk with flannel.\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://leo.fm/uploads/2024/tinties.jpg\" alt=\"Tin blag closures\" title=\"tinties.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"109\" height=\"51\" />\n\nTo help seal the nose area I use [peel and stick tin ties](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NAO56KH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), the kind used to seal up coffee bags at the grocery store. I experimented with these by ripping them off all our coffee bags, but it turns out you can buy them by the hundred on Amazon, so no more open coffee bags at the Laporte house. \n\nSealing the nose well is important for mask effectiveness and to keep my glasses from steaming up. If I'm not wearing glasses I'm wearing [protective lab goggles](https://www.amazon.com/LOHONER-Medical-Student-Protective-Anti-Fog/dp/B0868NZ714/ref=sr_1_1?crid=12MUP5K8ER3IS&dchild=1&keywords=lab+goggles&qid=1591801164&s=home-garden&sprefix=lab+goggl%2Cgarden%2C217&sr=1-1). Keeping the mouth, nose, and eyes protected from aerosolized virus particles is the goal here. \n\nTo soften the edges of the mask and block leaks around the edges, I have started folding all four edges in over a small strip of [cotton quilt batting](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F8MRLBG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). \n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://leo.fm/uploads/2024/momsmasks.jpg\" alt=\"Two masks for mom with my newest designs\" title=\"momsmasks.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"399\" height=\"250\" />\n\nThe batting adds some structure and softness to the edges and, as I learned when I used it as a layer in one of my masks, is practically impermeable. The mask on the left is for my mom. At 87-years-old she finds it hard to tie the string behind her head so I replaced it with [elastic](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08793W5R8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). \n\nThese masks are light, comfortable, and breathe-able. I don't have any evidence that they're more effective than any other mask, but I like to think so. \n\nWant to make your own masks?
