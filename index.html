			 <p>I created this site in the midst of a pandemic. Now two years later, it&rsquo;s over. Right?</p>
<p>Today mask mandates are lifted in our county and, despite <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/mask-mandates-can-people-stop-wearing-masks-covid-rcna14587">cowardly quibbling from the CDC</a>, most of the US. It seems the pandemic ends with a whimper, not a bang. Sunday&rsquo;s mostly-maskless Superbowl was the party we&rsquo;ve all been waiting for. And, yet, I&rsquo;m not exactly ready to celebrate. Personally, I&rsquo;m planning to tiptoe back, mask at the ready. I&rsquo;d love to make a pyre in the backyard to burn them all, but what if there&rsquo;s a new virulent variant? We still have Π Ρ Σ Τ Υ Φ Χ Ψ and Ω if we need them.</p>
<p>But, for now, I&rsquo;m willing to say Mission Accomplished. Good job everyone. Let&rsquo;s say a prayer for the nearly one million dead in the US, nearly six million worldwide (a chilling number) and get back to living. Save the remaining ivermectin for the horses, shall we?</p>
<p>Oh, and get your goldurn vaccine, will ya? For me? For all of us!</p>

			 <p>I pulled the trigger on a Monster Gaming Machine. I know it&rsquo;s crazy, but boys just want to have fun.</p>
<p>See I have a three-year-old iMac Pro, but it&rsquo;s getting flaky and I&rsquo;ve been eyeing my wife&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-ultrasharp-49-curved-monitor-u4919dw/apd/210-arnw/monitors-monitor-accessories">49&quot; monitor</a> for months.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Apple&rsquo;s never going to do something like that! And how long before they ship something powerful that can work with an external monitor: A high-end mac Mini or a new mini-Mac Pro?</p>
<p>I finally lost my patience and pulled the trigger on something <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/desktops-all-in-one-pcs/alienware-aurora-ryzen-edition-r10-gaming-desktop/spd/alienware-aurora-r10-desktop/wdryzr10v20hsb">completely different</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Maxed out with a Ryzen 7 5800X, nVidia GTX 3080, 128GB RAM, and dual 2TB drives (1 m.2, 1 spinning).</p>
<p>I know I could save money and probably get something better by building my own or going to a custom gaming PC maker, but these components are hard to get and I figure Dell can get them faster than anyone else. Even so this baby doesn&rsquo;t ship &lsquo;til May.</p>
<p>And as long as I&rsquo;m going for a power rig, I might as well go all out with a <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/new-alienware-55-oled-gaming-monitor-aw5520qf/apd/210-auds/monitors-monitor-accessories">monster monitor</a>, right?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A 55-inch OLED monitor that&rsquo;s absurdly expensive. (It&rsquo;s basically a hi-res TV but it costs a lot more.)</p>
<p>I rationalize this crazy purchase because</p>
<ol>
<li>I believe in open source, and like Linux as much as I like macOS. Dell supports Linux pretty well. (No I don&rsquo;t plan on using Windows. Ick.)</li>
<li>I really need to get to know the new PC hardware. Specifically The AMD Ryzen and the new nVidia ray-tracing GPUs.</li>
<li>I can&rsquo;t get an Xbox Series X or Playstation 5 to save my life, but I really want to play something new.</li>
<li>and the real reason&hellip; <a href="https://www.valheimgame.com">Valheim</a> (it runs on Linux!)</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been saving up for something like this for some time. It&rsquo;s kind of the Ultimate Gaming Machine for 2021.</p>
<p>OK tell me I&rsquo;m a fool. I&rsquo;m ready to be roasted. Or you can come over and watch me play Valheim come May.</p>
<p>UPDATE: It has arrived. I&rsquo;ve been playing with it all day and it&rsquo;s so fast. Super happy with the purchase. Dual booting Windows 10 with Manjaro Linux and everything is working perfectly. I think I&rsquo;m in love.</p>
<p>UPDATE (4 years later): I&rsquo;m still playing Valheim, but now it&rsquo;s on an M4Pro Mac mini with the same monster monitor. As usual, the monitor outlived the computer.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When I arrived at Kaiser they threw me a curve. &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Would you like Moderna or Johnson &amp; Johnson?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; I chose Moderna for a variety of reasons, but mostly because I think the mRNA technology is very cool. The process was quick and nearly painless. Afterwards I hod to wait 15 minutes, just in case I had a bad reaction. I didn&rsquo;t. My arm hurts a bit today, but that&rsquo;s the extent of the side effects. I expect worse after the second shot, April 14.</p>
<p>Now we just have to get the rest of my friends and family vaccinated and life can kind of get back to normal!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/frequent-rapid-testing-could-turn-national-covid-19-tide-within-weeks/">study</a> says</p>

<p>They are also affordable, he added. The rapid tests can cost as little as $1 each and return results in 15 minutes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Best of all, &ldquo;testing half the population weekly with inexpensive, rapid-turnaround COVID-19 tests would drive the virus toward elimination within weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is something we could do today to end the pandemic by Christmas. The FDA has already approved the tests.</p>

<p>(NOTE FROM 2024: Yet another example of how the pandemic was mishandled. Due to foot dragging from the FDA, the tests weren&rsquo;t in widespread use until 2022.)</p>

			 <p>One of our hosts asked me for some talent coaching. This is how I responded.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’ll tell you what I do, but this is only what works for me. I don’t have any talent. I can&rsquo;t tell jokes. I can’t juggle. I&rsquo;m not sexy. So all I can do is try to be myself, be likable, and serve my audience. I’m always trying to get to the love that’s at the core of all human interactions. For me, connecting with the audience is to love and honor who they are. And connecting with the audience is my job. It’s what I strive to do every time I’m on the air.</p>
<p>I do very little prep these days - I should definitely do more but I’m lazy. Remember I’ve been on the radio for 43 years, and doing interviews since 1987, so everything I do is totally internalized and mostly unconscious. There’s no way I could pass it on to you, and you wouldn’t want me to if I could, since the essence of being good on the air is to be totally yourself. And, bad news, you can’t <em>pursue</em> being centered and authentic on the air. You can only relax into it. And that just takes practice. It took me 15 years before I was any good.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In interviews, I am naturally curious. That helps. Always pay attention like a hawk to what people are saying. They’ll tell you what they want to talk about. Make it a conversation, not a series of questions. I will sometimes think of a question or two ahead of time, just so I have something to fall back on, but generally, if you are really engaged in the conversation, the next question will come easily. Never be thinking of what you’re going to ask next; you’ll miss the cues your guest is giving you. The essence of great interviewing is to be a great listener. Engage in the conversation and let your natural curiosity direct you. Be very careful about trying to show what you know. I hear a lot of interviewers trying to be smart. It’s better to be dumb. That’s how you learn.</p>
<p>I think it is worth trying to be as honest and genuine as you can be at all times. People can sniff inauthenticity. There’s plenty of it on the airwaves, but I believe people want to see you as you are. That’s scary because there’s always the risk people won’t like you, but it’s better to be yourself than to try to appeal to people by putting on a false persona. If they don’t like you, so be it.</p>
<p>Be open, be kind, and always aim toward honesty. It’s hard enough in real life, and it’s even harder on-the-air because you can&rsquo;t see your audience. It’s easy to fall into the trap of being automatic. Always strive to be present and always ask yourself, “am I telling the truth?”</p>
<p>Studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre">improv</a> was useful. In improv the rule is always to respond to every prompt with &ldquo;yes, and&rdquo; - never block, never say no. In improv you learn to listen. You also learn how to center and relax even while your energy is soaring. When the mic comes on you&rsquo;re going to feel a rush of energy. Use it, don&rsquo;t let it run you. You want to get into a heightened state of awareness without becoming amped up. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a> calls it flow. You&rsquo;re always working to get into the flow state. Also, learn how to pronounce long last names.</p>
<p>This is all very meta advice. I don’t do “talent coaching.” Sometimes coaching is as simple as telling someone to say “you know” less, but I don’t like to operate at that level. You should do that yourself. Watch video and look for repetitive verbal crutches and tics. Practice reading until you can be fluent, even the first time you see something. I make little notes to myself about goals, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t interrupt,&rdquo; &ldquo;slow down,&rdquo; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t curse,&rdquo; etc. and then store them in the back of my mind. Practice one thing at a time. It’s good to work on technique, but you don’t want to become self-conscious.</p>
<p>It’s like learning to be a pro-basketball player. You can work on your skills, and I guess you have to, but nothing is going to sing until you can stop being self-conscious enough to flow. If you’re “working at it” on-the-air it shows. Never let them see you sweat. You don’t want to make your audience worry about you. You want them to feel like you’re supremely confident and in control. But if you’re not, and stuff is falling apart, don’t hide it, be honest. Don’t freak out, enjoy yourself. That’s another way to be in control: own what’s going on. Your audience always knows exactly what’s going on. Don’t cover up, own up.</p>
<p>Sometimes it all goes to hell. It happens to all of us. Don’t sweat it. Tomorrow is another show. Keep striving to connect with your audience, to be human, to be honest, to be vulnerable. Strip away the protective shell we all wear and be present. The best on-air talent is totally real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to study others and notice what works. I love to study veteran performers. I am always impressed with how calm and in command they are. They never strive to entertain, they just do. Think of the person you like best on the air. What makes them interesting? What makes you <em>like</em> them? Find that in yourself. Don’t be them, of course, be you, but it&rsquo;s normal to start out by imitating your heroes and develop your own style later. I was heavily influenced by David Letterman, and copied his mannerisms for a long time. Before that it was Don Imus. I liked them because they never seemed to be trying to please their audiences. They had a &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; attitude. My career didn&rsquo;t take off until I stopped trying so hard. You don&rsquo;t want to be smarmy or ingratiating. Be cool.</p>
<p>Always remember you are there to serve your audience. That’s where the humility comes from. They aren&rsquo;t here to listen to you; you are there to serve them. To keep them company. To inform. To entertain. To make their lives better. Even just to give them a little break from the day-to-day. You are performing a great service. Be grateful for the opportunity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s everything I know about being on-the-air. Now forget what I said and be yourself. Getting to perform for others is a great privilege. Enjoy it.</p>

<p>Ira Glass from <em>This American Life</em> has the definitive quote: &ldquo;All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>The august <a href="https://aasm.org/american-academy-of-sleep-medicine-calls-for-elimination-of-daylight-saving-time/">Academy of Sleep Medicine</a> has finally proclaimed the truth.</p>

			 <p>New research shows that wearing masks makes a difference. But we <em>all</em> have to do it!</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/06/200609190727.htm">Science Daily</a>, reporting on a study from the University of Cambridge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The widespread use of face masks keeps the coronavirus reproduction number below 1.0, and prevents further waves when combined with lockdowns, new research suggests. A modeling study from the universities of Cambridge and Greenwich indicates that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2020.0376">lockdowns alone will not stop the resurgence of COVID-19</a>. Researchers say <strong>even homemade masks with limited effectiveness can dramatically reduce transmission rates</strong> if worn by enough people, regardless of whether they show symptoms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love making my own masks. I even bought a sewing machine to do it (the inexpensive <a href="https://www.mybernette.com/en-US/3-Series/Bernette-35.html">Bernina Bernett b35</a>, now sold out everywhere!) With a little practice you can make a mask like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s taken me a while to perfect this mask, but I love it because</p>
<ol>
<li>it&rsquo;s relatively easy to make</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s convenient to wear and take off</li>
<li>fit is snug and almost airtight</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s effective</li>
</ol>
<p>I started with this video then made some improvements:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zm_NmpdgWWA" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>One of the nicest features of this mask is how you tie it. There&rsquo;s one length of cord<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that goes around your neck and ties at the top of the head. It&rsquo;s effectively a drawstring which helps fit the mask snugly as you tie it. The neck loop is handy because you can take off the mask but leave it hanging around your neck for quick donning.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made some changes to the mask that makes it more comfortable and, I believe, more effective.</p>
<p>First the materials. In the video the designer recommends two layers with a filter pocket. I tried this using high-threadcount cotton for the outer layer <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and old t-shirts for the inner layer. The t-shirts are soft and comfortable but the pouch opening hits right at the mouth and kind of bothers me. And adding a filter layer (I tried vacuum cleaner bags and paper towels) really reduces breathe-ability. This is key; <strong>if it&rsquo;s not easy to breathe in a mask you won&rsquo;t wear it.</strong></p>
<p>After reading about research from the <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200424081648.htm">American Chemical Society</a> about the effectiveness of various materials for mask making:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One layer of a tightly woven cotton sheet combined with two layers of  polyester-spandex chiffon &ndash; a sheer fabric often used in evening gowns  &ndash; filtered out the most aerosol particles (80-99%, depending on  particle size), with performance close to that of an N95 mask material.  Substituting the chiffon with natural silk or flannel, or simply using a cotton quilt with cotton-polyester batting, produced similar results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I decided to eliminate the superfluous filter pouch and replace the t-shirt cotton with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FNDH3EY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">silk charmeuse</a>. It feels better, it&rsquo;s much easier to sew, and the breathe-ability is excellent. Come winter, and yes I expect us to still be wearing masks this winter, I&rsquo;ll replace the silk with flannel.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To help seal the nose area I use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NAO56KH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">peel and stick tin ties</a>, the kind used to seal up coffee bags at the grocery store. I experimented with these by ripping them off all our coffee bags, but it turns out you can buy them by the hundred on Amazon, so no more open coffee bags at the Laporte house.</p>
<p>Sealing the nose well is important for mask effectiveness and to keep my glasses from steaming up. If I&rsquo;m not wearing glasses I&rsquo;m wearing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LOHONER-Medical-Student-Protective-Anti-Fog/dp/B0868NZ714/ref=sr_1_1?crid=12MUP5K8ER3IS&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=lab+goggles&amp;qid=1591801164&amp;s=home-garden&amp;sprefix=lab+goggl%2Cgarden%2C217&amp;sr=1-1">protective lab goggles</a>. Keeping the mouth, nose, and eyes protected from aerosolized virus particles is the goal here.</p>
<p>To soften the edges of the mask and block leaks around the edges, I have started folding all four edges in over a small strip of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F8MRLBG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">cotton quilt batting</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The batting adds some structure and softness to the edges and, as I learned when I used it as a layer in one of my masks, is practically impermeable. The mask on the left is for my mom. At 87-years-old she finds it hard to tie the string behind her head so I replaced it with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08793W5R8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">elastic</a>.</p>
<p>These masks are light, comfortable, and breathe-able. I don&rsquo;t have any evidence that they&rsquo;re more effective than any other mask, but I like to think so.</p>

<p>This freaks out some people because they figure the outer part of the mask might be covered with covid. But if it is, then so is my shirt, hair, etc. The trick is to keep the virus from your mouth, nose, and eyes. So wash your hands after you touch the mask. And if you&rsquo;re that worried strip down when you get home and hop in the shower! These masks are <em>not</em> used the same way masks would be worn in a hospital. In a medical setting the mask is designed to protect the medical worker from an infected patient. We wear our masks to protect others from us. They also help keep us from touching our face when out and about.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
