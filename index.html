<p>I know sounds boring, but it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s really the story of the enshittification of the web. But, and here&rsquo;s the good news, Spotify wasn&rsquo;t able to co-opt podcasting, RSS podcasts still live and thrive. And I, for one, intend to keep it that way.</p>

<p>The $28 French dip is big enough to feed two people with big appetites. It delivers miraculous mouth feel along with rich, multi-tiered flavor. The fine-cut beef is dipped in jus before being layered with provolone cheese, caramelized onions and an aioli flavored with horseradish, chives and roasted garlic. It emerges from the oven warm, moist and begging to be devoured.

			 <p>Over 25 years ago a producer on “The Screen Savers” came to me and said “Do you know a Dick DeBartolo?”</p>
<p>“Uh,” I eloquently replied, “THE Dick DeBartolo, MAD Magazine’s maddest writer? Yeah! Why?”</p>
<p>“He wants to be on the show.”</p>
<p>Thus began a quarter-century love fest with one of my childhood heroes. And a chance to be immortalized in the magazine that taught me everything I know about modern culture. Well, the culture of the 60’s, anyway.</p>
<p>From the upcoming <a href="https://www.dc.com/mad">MAD Magazine #42</a>…(It’s a best-of so I guess it’s “bucket list ✔️ed again.”)</p>

			 <p>On the 20th Annniversary of the TWiT podcast, I thought it would be interesting to listen to an old show (#187) from March 2009. Turned out to be pretty good company as I did my taxes.</p>
<p>The panel included Kevin Rose, Jason Calacanis, Gina Trapani, Dan Patterson, and David Prager with cameos from Samm Levine, LeVar Burton, and Kevin Pollak.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foursquare debuts at South by Southwest</li>
<li>negative uproar over the brand new Facebook News Feed</li>
<li>who should replace Steve Jobs</li>
<li>rumors of an Apple tablet</li>
<li>early Twitter</li>
</ul>
<p>and the birth of surveillance capitalism. What a time. In technology sixteen years is a lifetime.</p>

			 <p>“Leo had a productive and engaging day filled with conversations about technology, artificial intelligence, and the future. He started his day baking sourdough baguettes and coordinating guest appearances for his upcoming AI-focused show, &ldquo;Intelligent Machines.&rdquo; During a lively recording session for TWiT, Leo and his guests discussed the latest AI developments, including Deep Seek&rsquo;s impact on the stock market and OpenAI&rsquo;s response. The conversation touched on AI safety and regulation, the potential for AI to replace engineers, and Apple&rsquo;s decision to cancel its AR glasses project. Leo shared his enthusiasm for AI tools, confessing to being an &ldquo;AI accelerationist.&rdquo; Later in the evening, Leo enjoyed a piano lesson, focusing on relaxation techniques while playing. He also spent time with his cat, sharing a heartwarming moment playing &ldquo;When the Saints Go Marching In&rdquo; on the piano.”</p>

<p>No live coding this time. Life intervened and I couldn&rsquo;t get around to part two for a day or so. And then I felt like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz. I kept seeing all these things about topological sorts and bogosorts and I assumed I had to do some weird stuff on part two. When all along I had the answer right here. Just click my heels together three times. Er. I mean, just sort the out of order updates based on the rules I already had.</p>

			 <p>I created this site in the midst of a pandemic. Now two years later, it&rsquo;s over. Right?</p>
<p>Today mask mandates are lifted in our county and, despite <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/mask-mandates-can-people-stop-wearing-masks-covid-rcna14587">cowardly quibbling from the CDC</a>, most of the US. It seems the pandemic ends with a whimper, not a bang. Sunday&rsquo;s mostly-maskless Superbowl was the party we&rsquo;ve all been waiting for. And, yet, I&rsquo;m not exactly ready to celebrate. Personally, I&rsquo;m planning to tiptoe back, mask at the ready. I&rsquo;d love to make a pyre in the backyard to burn them all, but what if there&rsquo;s a new virulent variant? We still have Π Ρ Σ Τ Υ Φ Χ Ψ and Ω if we need them.</p>
<p>But, for now, I&rsquo;m willing to say Mission Accomplished. Good job everyone. Let&rsquo;s say a prayer for the nearly one million dead in the US, nearly six million worldwide (a chilling number) and get back to living. Save the remaining ivermectin for the horses, shall we?</p>
<p>Oh, and get your goldurn vaccine, will ya? For me? For all of us!</p>

			 <p>I pulled the trigger on a Monster Gaming Machine. I know it&rsquo;s crazy, but boys just want to have fun.</p>
<p>See I have a three-year-old iMac Pro, but it&rsquo;s getting flaky and I&rsquo;ve been eyeing my wife&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-ultrasharp-49-curved-monitor-u4919dw/apd/210-arnw/monitors-monitor-accessories">49&quot; monitor</a> for months.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Apple&rsquo;s never going to do something like that! And how long before they ship something powerful that can work with an external monitor: A high-end mac Mini or a new mini-Mac Pro?</p>
<p>I finally lost my patience and pulled the trigger on something <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/desktops-all-in-one-pcs/alienware-aurora-ryzen-edition-r10-gaming-desktop/spd/alienware-aurora-r10-desktop/wdryzr10v20hsb">completely different</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Maxed out with a Ryzen 7 5800X, nVidia GTX 3080, 128GB RAM, and dual 2TB drives (1 m.2, 1 spinning).</p>
<p>I know I could save money and probably get something better by building my own or going to a custom gaming PC maker, but these components are hard to get and I figure Dell can get them faster than anyone else. Even so this baby doesn&rsquo;t ship &lsquo;til May.</p>
<p>And as long as I&rsquo;m going for a power rig, I might as well go all out with a <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/new-alienware-55-oled-gaming-monitor-aw5520qf/apd/210-auds/monitors-monitor-accessories">monster monitor</a>, right?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A 55-inch OLED monitor that&rsquo;s absurdly expensive. (It&rsquo;s basically a hi-res TV but it costs a lot more.)</p>
<p>I rationalize this crazy purchase because</p>
<ol>
<li>I believe in open source, and like Linux as much as I like macOS. Dell supports Linux pretty well. (No I don&rsquo;t plan on using Windows. Ick.)</li>
<li>I really need to get to know the new PC hardware. Specifically The AMD Ryzen and the new nVidia ray-tracing GPUs.</li>
<li>I can&rsquo;t get an Xbox Series X or Playstation 5 to save my life, but I really want to play something new.</li>
<li>and the real reason&hellip; <a href="https://www.valheimgame.com">Valheim</a> (it runs on Linux!)</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been saving up for something like this for some time. It&rsquo;s kind of the Ultimate Gaming Machine for 2021.</p>
<p>OK tell me I&rsquo;m a fool. I&rsquo;m ready to be roasted. Or you can come over and watch me play Valheim come May.</p>
<p>UPDATE: It has arrived. I&rsquo;ve been playing with it all day and it&rsquo;s so fast. Super happy with the purchase. Dual booting Windows 10 with Manjaro Linux and everything is working perfectly. I think I&rsquo;m in love.</p>
<p>UPDATE (4 years later): I&rsquo;m still playing Valheim, but now it&rsquo;s on an M4Pro Mac mini with the same monster monitor. As usual, the monitor outlived the computer.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When I arrived at Kaiser they threw me a curve. &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Would you like Moderna or Johnson &amp; Johnson?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; I chose Moderna for a variety of reasons, but mostly because I think the mRNA technology is very cool. The process was quick and nearly painless. Afterwards I hod to wait 15 minutes, just in case I had a bad reaction. I didn&rsquo;t. My arm hurts a bit today, but that&rsquo;s the extent of the side effects. I expect worse after the second shot, April 14.</p>
<p>Now we just have to get the rest of my friends and family vaccinated and life can kind of get back to normal!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One of our hosts asked me for some talent coaching. This is how I responded.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’ll tell you what I do, but this is only what works for me. I don’t have any talent. I can&rsquo;t tell jokes. I can’t juggle. I&rsquo;m not sexy. So all I can do is try to be myself, be likable, and serve my audience. I’m always trying to get to the love that’s at the core of all human interactions. For me, connecting with the audience is to love and honor who they are. And connecting with the audience is my job. It’s what I strive to do every time I’m on the air.</p>
<p>I do very little prep these days - I should definitely do more but I’m lazy. Remember I’ve been on the radio for 43 years, and doing interviews since 1987, so everything I do is totally internalized and mostly unconscious. There’s no way I could pass it on to you, and you wouldn’t want me to if I could, since the essence of being good on the air is to be totally yourself. And, bad news, you can’t <em>pursue</em> being centered and authentic on the air. You can only relax into it. And that just takes practice. It took me 15 years before I was any good.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In interviews, I am naturally curious. That helps. Always pay attention like a hawk to what people are saying. They’ll tell you what they want to talk about. Make it a conversation, not a series of questions. I will sometimes think of a question or two ahead of time, just so I have something to fall back on, but generally, if you are really engaged in the conversation, the next question will come easily. Never be thinking of what you’re going to ask next; you’ll miss the cues your guest is giving you. The essence of great interviewing is to be a great listener. Engage in the conversation and let your natural curiosity direct you. Be very careful about trying to show what you know. I hear a lot of interviewers trying to be smart. It’s better to be dumb. That’s how you learn.</p>
<p>I think it is worth trying to be as honest and genuine as you can be at all times. People can sniff inauthenticity. There’s plenty of it on the airwaves, but I believe people want to see you as you are. That’s scary because there’s always the risk people won’t like you, but it’s better to be yourself than to try to appeal to people by putting on a false persona. If they don’t like you, so be it.</p>
<p>Be open, be kind, and always aim toward honesty. It’s hard enough in real life, and it’s even harder on-the-air because you can&rsquo;t see your audience. It’s easy to fall into the trap of being automatic. Always strive to be present and always ask yourself, “am I telling the truth?”</p>
<p>Studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre">improv</a> was useful. In improv the rule is always to respond to every prompt with &ldquo;yes, and&rdquo; - never block, never say no. In improv you learn to listen. You also learn how to center and relax even while your energy is soaring. When the mic comes on you&rsquo;re going to feel a rush of energy. Use it, don&rsquo;t let it run you. You want to get into a heightened state of awareness without becoming amped up. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a> calls it flow. You&rsquo;re always working to get into the flow state. Also, learn how to pronounce long last names.</p>
<p>This is all very meta advice. I don’t do “talent coaching.” Sometimes coaching is as simple as telling someone to say “you know” less, but I don’t like to operate at that level. You should do that yourself. Watch video and look for repetitive verbal crutches and tics. Practice reading until you can be fluent, even the first time you see something. I make little notes to myself about goals, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t interrupt,&rdquo; &ldquo;slow down,&rdquo; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t curse,&rdquo; etc. and then store them in the back of my mind. Practice one thing at a time. It’s good to work on technique, but you don’t want to become self-conscious.</p>
<p>It’s like learning to be a pro-basketball player. You can work on your skills, and I guess you have to, but nothing is going to sing until you can stop being self-conscious enough to flow. If you’re “working at it” on-the-air it shows. Never let them see you sweat. You don’t want to make your audience worry about you. You want them to feel like you’re supremely confident and in control. But if you’re not, and stuff is falling apart, don’t hide it, be honest. Don’t freak out, enjoy yourself. That’s another way to be in control: own what’s going on. Your audience always knows exactly what’s going on. Don’t cover up, own up.</p>
<p>Sometimes it all goes to hell. It happens to all of us. Don’t sweat it. Tomorrow is another show. Keep striving to connect with your audience, to be human, to be honest, to be vulnerable. Strip away the protective shell we all wear and be present. The best on-air talent is totally real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to study others and notice what works. I love to study veteran performers. I am always impressed with how calm and in command they are. They never strive to entertain, they just do. Think of the person you like best on the air. What makes them interesting? What makes you <em>like</em> them? Find that in yourself. Don’t be them, of course, be you, but it&rsquo;s normal to start out by imitating your heroes and develop your own style later. I was heavily influenced by David Letterman, and copied his mannerisms for a long time. Before that it was Don Imus. I liked them because they never seemed to be trying to please their audiences. They had a &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; attitude. My career didn&rsquo;t take off until I stopped trying so hard. You don&rsquo;t want to be smarmy or ingratiating. Be cool.</p>
<p>Always remember you are there to serve your audience. That’s where the humility comes from. They aren&rsquo;t here to listen to you; you are there to serve them. To keep them company. To inform. To entertain. To make their lives better. Even just to give them a little break from the day-to-day. You are performing a great service. Be grateful for the opportunity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s everything I know about being on-the-air. Now forget what I said and be yourself. Getting to perform for others is a great privilege. Enjoy it.</p>

<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Ira Glass from <em>This American Life</em> has the definitive quote: &ldquo;All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Normally I wait until Spring to start complaining, but I&rsquo;ve gotten nothing else done this summer, so I&rsquo;m going to start the campaign early. End Daylight Saving Time!</p>
<p>The august <a href="https://aasm.org/american-academy-of-sleep-medicine-calls-for-elimination-of-daylight-saving-time/">Academy of Sleep Medicine</a> has finally proclaimed the truth.</p>

<p>“Permanent, year-round standard time is the best choice to most closely match our circadian sleep-wake cycle,” said lead author Dr. M.

			 <p>New research shows that wearing masks makes a difference. But we <em>all</em> have to do it!</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/06/200609190727.htm">Science Daily</a>, reporting on a study from the University of Cambridge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The widespread use of face masks keeps the coronavirus reproduction number below 1.0, and prevents further waves when combined with lockdowns, new research suggests. A modeling study from the universities of Cambridge and Greenwich indicates that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2020.0376">lockdowns alone will not stop the resurgence of COVID-19</a>. Researchers say <strong>even homemade masks with limited effectiveness can dramatically reduce transmission rates</strong> if worn by enough people, regardless of whether they show symptoms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love making my own masks. I even bought a sewing machine to do it (the inexpensive <a href="https://www.mybernette.com/en-US/3-Series/Bernette-35.html">Bernina Bernett b35</a>, now sold out everywhere!) With a little practice you can make a mask like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s taken me a while to perfect this mask, but I love it because</p>
<ol>
<li>it&rsquo;s relatively easy to make</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s convenient to wear and take off</li>
<li>fit is snug and almost airtight</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s effective</li>
</ol>
<p>I started with this video then made some improvements:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zm_NmpdgWWA" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>One of the nicest features of this mask is how you tie it. There&rsquo;s one length of cord<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that goes around your neck and ties at the top of the head. It&rsquo;s effectively a drawstring which helps fit the mask snugly as you tie it. The neck loop is handy because you can take off the mask but leave it hanging around your neck for quick donning.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made some changes to the mask that makes it more comfortable and, I believe, more effective.</p>
<p>First the materials. In the video the designer recommends two layers with a filter pocket. I tried this using high-threadcount cotton for the outer layer <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and old t-shirts for the inner layer. The t-shirts are soft and comfortable but the pouch opening hits right at the mouth and kind of bothers me. And adding a filter layer (I tried vacuum cleaner bags and paper towels) really reduces breathe-ability. This is key; <strong>if it&rsquo;s not easy to breathe in a mask you won&rsquo;t wear it.</strong></p>
<p>After reading about research from the <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200424081648.htm">American Chemical Society</a> about the effectiveness of various materials for mask making:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One layer of a tightly woven cotton sheet combined with two layers of  polyester-spandex chiffon &ndash; a sheer fabric often used in evening gowns  &ndash; filtered out the most aerosol particles (80-99%, depending on  particle size), with performance close to that of an N95 mask material.  Substituting the chiffon with natural silk or flannel, or simply using a cotton quilt with cotton-polyester batting, produced similar results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I decided to eliminate the superfluous filter pouch and replace the t-shirt cotton with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FNDH3EY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">silk charmeuse</a>. It feels better, it&rsquo;s much easier to sew, and the breathe-ability is excellent. Come winter, and yes I expect us to still be wearing masks this winter, I&rsquo;ll replace the silk with flannel.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To help seal the nose area I use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NAO56KH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">peel and stick tin ties</a>, the kind used to seal up coffee bags at the grocery store. I experimented with these by ripping them off all our coffee bags, but it turns out you can buy them by the hundred on Amazon, so no more open coffee bags at the Laporte house.</p>
<p>Sealing the nose well is important for mask effectiveness and to keep my glasses from steaming up. If I&rsquo;m not wearing glasses I&rsquo;m wearing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LOHONER-Medical-Student-Protective-Anti-Fog/dp/B0868NZ714/ref=sr_1_1?crid=12MUP5K8ER3IS&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=lab+goggles&amp;qid=1591801164&amp;s=home-garden&amp;sprefix=lab+goggl%2Cgarden%2C217&amp;sr=1-1">protective lab goggles</a>. Keeping the mouth, nose, and eyes protected from aerosolized virus particles is the goal here.</p>
<p>To soften the edges of the mask and block leaks around the edges, I have started folding all four edges in over a small strip of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F8MRLBG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">cotton quilt batting</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The batting adds some structure and softness to the edges and, as I learned when I used it as a layer in one of my masks, is practically impermeable. The mask on the left is for my mom. At 87-years-old she finds it hard to tie the string behind her head so I replaced it with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08793W5R8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">elastic</a>.</p>
<p>These masks are light, comfortable, and breathe-able. I don&rsquo;t have any evidence that they&rsquo;re more effective than any other mask, but I like to think so.</p>

<p>This freaks out some people because they figure the outer part of the mask might be covered with covid. But if it is, then so is my shirt, hair, etc. The trick is to keep the virus from your mouth, nose, and eyes. So wash your hands after you touch the mask. And if you&rsquo;re that worried strip down when you get home and hop in the shower! These masks are <em>not</em> used the same way masks would be worn in a hospital. In a medical setting the mask is designed to protect the medical worker from an infected patient. We wear our masks to protect others from us.

			 <p>Last month, when the weather in Petaluma turned nice, I started riding my e-bike to work every day. Until last week.</p>
<p>The trip is only a couple of miles, and takes fewer than 10 minutes, but there&rsquo;s one spot that always gives me the heebie jeebies.</p>
<p>The Corona Road overpass is a narrow bridge with an even narrower bike path. Whenever I cross it I try to wait for a break in the traffic, and that&rsquo;s been a lot easier during quarantine. But as the traffic&rsquo;s been getting busier I&rsquo;ve been getting more worried. And then, last week, the worst happened. One hour before I would have been crossing the bridge a  bicyclist was hit and killed by a driver under the influence.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve crossed that spot hundreds of times, but no more. I don&rsquo;t know Joze, but I feel for him and his family. From now on I&rsquo;ll be crossing that bridge in my car and reserve my rides for somewhere safer.</p>

			 <p>Exactly five years ago, we debuted the &ldquo;new&rdquo; <a href="https://twit.tv">TWiT web site</a>. I wrote the following post shortly after. It&rsquo;s buried somewhere on the site (that&rsquo;s one part of the design I wish we&rsquo;d done better) so I wanted to &ldquo;resurrect&rdquo; it here. The annotations are from today.</p>

<p>The Internet is changing. And so are we. The way web sites look seems to change every few months, but even the way they work, and the very reason they exist has shifted since the first pages at twit.tv went up in 2005.</p>
<p>I designed and implemented that original site by myself, choosing Drupal 4 as the content management system. It didn&rsquo;t take long, as we added more shows and more hosts, for TWiT to outgrow that very simple original design. I asked Amber MacArthur, host of <em>Inside The Net</em> on TWiT, and her brother Jeff, to redesign the site. Their company, MGImedia Communications, crafted a new look and user interface for us and I hired the best Drupal programmers I knew, Lullabot, to implement it.  TWiT.tv v2.0, engineered chiefly by Ted Serbinski, went live in 2007 and served us well for four years. But changes in our business and intense growth prompted another redesign by ImageX in 2011. By the end of 2014 I had decided it was time for another re-design, but this time I wanted to undertake something more ambitious.</p>
<p>In talks about new media for more than 10 years I&rsquo;ve been saying that our job was to provide content for our audience  <em>when they wanted, where they wanted, in any form they wanted, without limitations on how they could consume it.</em></p>
<p>(I remember telling that to a convention of HBO employees in 2004 and almost being shown the door. But even HBO is coming around.) One of the reasons I&rsquo;ve always made TWiT ad-supported is because it let us do that. It was in our interest to serve up our shows live or on-demand, in audio or video, and everywhere you wanted to watch.</p>
<p>In the early days of TWiT that meant a web site to provide you with a directory of shows and RSS feeds. Most people, once they found out about TWiT, went to iTunes to subscribe. And that was how 90% of our audience listened for years.</p>
<h3 id="fast-forward-to-the-present">Fast Forward to the Present</h3>
<p>Today the market is much more fragmented. iTunes downloads are down to about 16% of the total. Another 10% of our audience watches the live stream either on the web site or by plugging the URL into a video player like VLC. 30% download pre-recorded shows via the web site.  All the rest, nearly half, use apps to watch or listen on their mobile phones, tablets, Rokus, TiVOs, Samsung TVs, many other platforms.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I consider this a success. We&rsquo;ve put TWiT in front of our audiences wherever they want it. But it means that our web site plays a very different role. And mobile apps are becoming increasingly important.</p>
<p>As I began to appreciate this drastic change in how you watch and listen, I came to the realization that we needed to pay more attention to mobile while not ignoring the web. I, and many others, began to think of what we do as not broadcasting, or podcasting, but content as a service, or CaaS.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> That&rsquo;s a pretty high-falutin' term, but it does describe what we&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>RSS feeds were a step in this direction, making it possible for readers and listeners to subscribe to a feed and get content in any manner they wanted. Instead of forcing you to read the news in a newspaper or on a web page, RSS feeds let you decide how you&rsquo;d read and in what form. But RSS doesn&rsquo;t go far enough. We are taking it a step farther and creating a full-blown API that can deliver our content, all the meta-data associated with it, and additional information about our hosts, sponsors, and events on demand to any app that wants it. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Our new web site is just once consumer of this API. We&rsquo;re developing new apps on iOS, Android, and Windows that will also use the API.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> And we&rsquo;re inviting anyone who knows how to make a JSON call to create their own sites and apps. What we&rsquo;re unveiling today is much more than a new web site, it&rsquo;s a new way to deliver content that empowers my dream to give our audience the shows when they want, where they want, how they want without limits.</p>
<h3 id="headless-drupal">Headless Drupal</h3>
<p>We met with several great Drupal design teams late last year to begin the process of creating a new site. One, Four Kitchens out of Austin, told us about an exciting new technique they had developed for a couple of their big media clients. This technique, called &ldquo;Headless Drupal,&rdquo; used the robust Drupal content management system for data entry (I&rsquo;m writing this in a Drupal form right now) <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> and to serve the API calls.</p>
<h3 id="the-front-end">The Front End</h3>
<p>But Four Kitchens didn&rsquo;t use Drupal for the web site. Instead they recommended a more modern and flexible tool called node.js. Unlike previous web sites, the site itself wouldn&rsquo;t be a content management system, it would only be a representation of the content via the API.  I liked the idea for several reasons.</p>
<p>First, Drupal&rsquo;s presentation is looking a little old and staid next to the spiffy, responsive sites other media companies are using. I liked the idea of being able to use a more modern tool like node.js.</p>
<p>Second, by decoupling the backend from the presentation, it would be easier and faster to create new sites. Web design styles change faster than high fashion, so it&rsquo;s nice to be able to update the site without re-doing all the hard work on the backend.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="the-apps">The Apps</h3>
<p>Third, having a complete API would make it easier to do apps. The app, just like the web site, would have access to everything there is to know about TWiT, in a simple, orderly fashion.</p>
<p>Finally, by making the API public, we encourage members of our audience to create new things, things we might never have thought of. You could even design a web site you like better. Abstracting the content from the presentation seems like a big win.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>So while you may think we&rsquo;re unveiling a new web site here, we&rsquo;re really just showing you the tip of the iceberg. Most of the work was done on the backend and is invisible to you.</p>
<h3 id="the-site">The Site</h3>
<p>Let me talk about the various pieces that go into this new twit.tv.</p>
<p>We asked the Four Kitchens design team to create something very visual and clean. We feel that people come to the web site for two reasons: first because they googled one of us or were looking for tech information. Those people need to get a quick idea of what twit is and what we do. The front page is designed to do that with the big hero images, quick statements of purpose, and a gallery of recent shows in our three main categories: tech news, help and how-tos, and reviews.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p>The second reason people come to the site is to find content. These people already know about TWiT, but they want to quickly find and download a show, watch the live stream, or seach for information they heard on a show. The top navigation reflects those primary purposes: Live, Shows, Apps, Search and More&hellip; (where we stick everything else). We&rsquo;re using Apache Solr search and I think it&rsquo;s a major upgrade to our old search.</p>
<p>The site is fully mobile responsive and looks great on every size screen. You can see for yourself by resizing the page and refreshing. We think the site might even look best on mobile - and that&rsquo;s good because that&rsquo;s how most people surf these days!</p>
<h3 id="roll-the-credits">Roll the Credits</h3>
<p>My deepest thanks to Four Kitchens' designer Jared John for the look and feel (and the lovely Verlag font up front). Kevin Lamping did the dust programming. Peter Sieg was the node.js lead. Any missing or broken features are not their fault - they&rsquo;re ours. We had a strict budget and weren&rsquo;t abe to add many of the cool features we all wanted. But we have an ongoing support contract with Four Kitchens and hope to add the most requested missing features over time. We have a backlog of well over 100 features we didn&rsquo;t have the time or money to implement in version 1.0 I also suspect we&rsquo;ll be ready to do a second phase with Four Kitchens when everybody recovers from this one. In about a year.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
<p>The stuff you don&rsquo;t see is even more amazing. Four Kitchens' Drupal dev David Diers took the lead here and worked many long hours (and weekends, too) to get us to launch. Matt Grill played the part of the cavalry, swooping in to make sure SSL worked right, and backing David on getting the API up and running. The two of them worked miracles, and if you enjoy the API, buy them a beer the next time you&rsquo;re in Austin or San Diego (that&rsquo;s where Matt is). I want to buy them a whole brewery.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>
<p>The entire process used the Agile methodology, and our project leaders, Paul Benjamin and Suzy Bates, kept the Jira log humming through 279 user stories and 730 points in nine sprints over the past six months. And if you know Agile you&rsquo;ll know what that means.</p>
<p>On the TWiT Team, credit to Patrick Delahanty who re-coded our workflow engine, Elroy, to interface with Drupal so that our editors and producers could move their entire data entry workflow to the Drupal backend. And he did it in about a month. Patrick is the official first API user. I managed the project with help from our CEO Lisa Laporte, Engineering Manager, Bruce Chezem, and analyst Jeff Needles.</p>
<p>The Drupal 7.0 backend is running on Acquia servers<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> using memcache and Varnish to speed things up. The web front end is running on Heroku. The API is documented at Apiary with key service from 3Scale. Node.js caching is provided by RedisLabs. Video and audio playback on the site is from JW Player. All TWiT shows and RSS feeds are stored and served by Cachefly.</p>
<p>Many of the pictures you see on the site were shot by Jason Guy at JasonGuyPhotography.com.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>
<p>I hope you like the new TWiT.tv 4.0. Please give me your feedback at <a href="mailto:leo@leoville.com">leo@leoville.com</a>. We&rsquo;ll fix the bugs as fast as we can, and adjust the interface to better suit your needs when we can afford it. Meanwhile, brush up on your RESTful API calls. I can&rsquo;t wait to see what you do with it.</p>

<p>After spending $75,000 on these apps with a third-party developer we abandoned them as unusable. The development team attempted to use a cross-platform app framework. It didn&rsquo;t work.

<p>And, in fact, we&rsquo;ve changed the original, elegant, design considerably to reflect the needs of our marketing department. Honestly, I thought the original design was perfect, but over time we wanted to make it easier to discover our shows. The flexibility designed into the front end has definitely paid off.&#160;<a href="#fnref:6" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:7" role="doc-endnote">
<p>And there have been some fantastic apps using the API fully - like Patrick Hickey&rsquo;s <a href="https://twit.tv/posts/picks/ios-pick-mytwit">MyTWiT</a> (no longer available). There&rsquo;s a list of current apps on the site, <a href="https://twit.tv/apps.">twit.tv/apps.</a> I&rsquo;m not sure how many of them use the API - frankly RSS is much easier.&#160;<a href="#fnref:7" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>As I mentioned, this is how the site <em>used</em> to look. It has changed considerably since then.&#160;<a href="#fnref:8" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:9" role="doc-endnote">
<p>And lots of credit to our in house engineer, Patrick Delahanty, who has maintained the site and overseen many changes to make it more usable. We didn&rsquo;t get to add a lot of those 100 features (web engineering is damn expensive) but I think we&rsquo;ve got a very useful and functional site.&#160;<a href="#fnref:9" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>We still use the Drupal backend, mostly unchanged, throughout our workflow. Once a show is edited it&rsquo;s published to the endpoints, including Cachefly and YouTube, by Drupal. Producers create the show notes in Drupal, and editors put relevant metadata into the Drupal backend where it propagates to everywhere else.&#160;<a href="#fnref:10" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			 <p>Lately I feel like Twitter and its users are suffering from some sort of mass psychosis. It&rsquo;s all id - to use a Freudian term. And it&rsquo;s communicable. I&rsquo;ve seen normal rational people descend into madness tweet by tweet. I&rsquo;ve felt it happen to me. Why? Is it the format that breeds this? Does that mean it would happen here? Or is it format + critical mass, like a petri dish? Could this medium breed generosity and kindness instead of rage and agression? What do you think?</p>
