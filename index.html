			 <p>Just in case you&rsquo;re curious, here&rsquo;s a description of the various hardware and software I use to work and play.</p>
<p>(NOTE: this is pretty out of date - I still use some of these things but since we&rsquo;ve closed the studio my home office has become my podcast studio. So there&rsquo;s a lot of new gear. I&rsquo;ll update this soon!)</p>
<p>This is a work in progress, but over time should reflect the entirety of my toolset. My hope is to keep this up-to-date because things change regularly. If there&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;d like to know and you don&rsquo;t see it here ask in the comments at the bottom of the page!</p>
<p>I realize that the following is a ridiculously large menagerie of gear. That&rsquo;s an occupational hazard. I review more gear than the average bear, but I do keep the stuff that suits me best. One small point, I almost always buy all the gear I use. I generally don&rsquo;t ask for or use review units or loaners. I think it gives me a more realistic idea of what owning this gear is like, and this way I&rsquo;m not beholden to anyone. Any exceptions are indicated below.</p>
<h3 id="home-office">Home Office</h3>
<p>I have a ~300 sq ft home office with several book shelves and a built-in desk in the bay window. There&rsquo;s a comfy armchair and ottoman I&rsquo;ve had for years, a less comfy chair from the studio, a couple of side tables.</p>

</a>

</p>
<p>Sitting on my desk in the office are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Alienware Aurora Ryzen Edition R10 gaming desk top from April 2021<br>
Ryzen 7 5800 X (8-core, 32MB Cache 4.7GHz)<br>
Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 10Gb G DDR6X<br>
128GB Dual Channel DDR4 XMP at 3400MHz<br>
2TB M.2 SSD<br>
2 TB SATA drive<br>
Dark Side of the Moon chassis with High-Performance CPU Liquid Cooling and 1000W Power Supply
I use a 5TB Drobo Mini for backup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apple Mac Studio Max
M1 Max
32 GB RAM
1 TB SSD
connected to a 4TB OWC <a href="https://www.owcdigital.com/products/express-4m2">Express 4M2</a> Thunderbolt 3 external drive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Xbox Seriex X 1TB</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each connected to a 55&quot; Alienware 120Hz 4K gaming monitor. I switch devices using the remote control that came with the monitor.</p>
<p>Audio goes to  a pair of <a href="https://audioengineusa.com/shop/wirelessspeakers/a2-wireless-computer-speakers/">Audioengine 2</a> wired speakers with an Audioengine S8 subwoofer beneath the desk. I use an Alienware 310K Mech. Gaming Keyboard and 510M RGB Gaming Mouse mostly to play Valheim. The Dell dual boots Manjaro Linux and Windows 11.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not sitting at my desk, I primarily use one of my more portable devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 2021 Macbook Pro 14&quot; running Apple&rsquo;s M1 Pro processor with 16 GB RAM and a 512 TB SSD (these days my go-to device)</li>
<li>A 2021 <a href="https://frame.work/laptop-diy-edition">Framework DIY Laptop</a> with Intel i7-1185G7, 32GB RAM, 2TB M.2 drive and 1TB USB drive runing Manjaro</li>
<li>A 2020 iPad Pro 12.9&quot; with the Magic Keyboard.</li>
<li>A 2021 iPad Mini</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a 2016 17&quot; <a href="https://system76.com/laptops/oryx">System76 Oryx Pro</a> i7/32GB/2.5TB/GTX980 laptop. It weighs about 10 pounds but I don&rsquo;t have the heart to give it away. It&rsquo;s running, you guessed it, Manjaro Linux Gnome Edition.</p>
<p>All my systems have synced Document, Source Code, and dotfile directories using the excellent and free open-source <a href="https://syncthing.net">SyncThing</a>. I keep system build instructions and scripts in <a href="https://notion.so">Notion</a> which I also use for fancy note-taking. For day-to-day notes, to-dos, and lists I use emacs org-mode.</p>
<p>Because this site is running on a server (cf. <a href="https://leolaporte.com/2016/07/21/a-grand-experiment/">The Beast</a>) in the studio. I keep logged into it via a tmux session running over mosh on all the systems (even the iPad using the <a href="https://blink.sh/">Blink terminal</a>).</p>
<p>An emacs daemon is always running on the Beast so it&rsquo;s easy to jump into any post exactly where I left off from any system although right now I&rsquo;m editing this using Emacs Tramp mode from home on my M1 Pro Macbook.  This web site runs on <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a>, so I simply save the markdown file, rebuild the site (it takes about 200 milliseconds to rebuild it from scratch with hugo) and jump back into emacs (^XS ^Z hugo fg - it&rsquo;s practically muscle memory). If you see any stray XSs in any of the posts you&rsquo;ll know I accidentally hit the shift key instead of the Control key. To avoid this I always map Caps Lock to the control key. The other tmux panes monitor the five Minecraft instances also running on the server (using Spigot), <a href="https://weechat.org">WeeChat IRC</a> logged into the TWiT IRC channel, and our <a href="https://jitsi.org/">Jitsi videoconferencing</a> server.</p>
<h4 id="smartphones">Smartphones</h4>
<p>My daily carry is a two-year old T-Mobile iPhone 12 Pro Max in a red Apple silicon case. I also carry a Fi-based Google Pixel 6 Pro Android phone and a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra on Verizon. I&rsquo;m wearing a Series 6 Apple Watch or, occasionally, a Samsung Galaxy Watch4 and an <a href="https://ouraring.com/product/heritage-silver">Oura 3rd generation smart ring</a>.</p>
<h4 id="cameras">Cameras</h4>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I use a couple of different camera systems. I shoot stills with the Sony A7RIV mirrorless camera typically with Sony FE 24mm f1.4 GM or <a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/camera-lenses/sel50f14z">Zeiss Planar T* FE 50mm F1.4 FE</a> lenses. My daily carry for street photography is a <a href="https://us.leica-camera.com/Photography/Leica-Q/Leica-Q2">Leica Q2</a> with its fixed 28mm F1.7 lens. I carry the Leica in a beautiful case and strap from <a href="https://www.angelo-pelle.com/product/half-case-for-leica-q2">Angelo Pelle</a>. A beautiful camera deserves a beautiful case.</p>
<h4 id="av">A/V</h4>
<p>For Zoom calls and audio recording on the iMac, I use a <a href="https://heilsound.com/products/pr-40/">Heil PR-40</a> mic. It&rsquo;s connected via USB using a SoundDevices <a href="https://www.sounddevices.com/mixpre/">MixPre-3</a>. As I do in the studio, I use custom-molded in-ear monitors from <a href="https://jhaudio.com">JH Audio</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AKG-K240STUDIO-Semi-Open-Professional-Headphones/dp/B0001ARCFA/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=akg+k240&amp;qid=1610399210&amp;sr=8-2">AKG K240</a> headphones.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When I do radio shows from here, I use the same gear connected to a <a href="https://www.comrex.com/products/access-portable-2usb-audio-codec/">Comrex Access2</a> audio codec over IP. We&rsquo;ve replaced ISDN in the studio with a similar unit. Although these devices use the public Internet instead of direct ISDN lines, they work just as well.</p>
<p>On the other side of the office, there&rsquo;s a 55&quot; curved <a href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/tvs/curved-oled-s9c/">Samsung OLED</a> which I bought in 2013 for a ridiculous amount of money. It&rsquo;s connected to Denon AVR S910W A/V receiver which feeds it signals from a <a href="https://www.silicondust.com/product/hdhomerun-prime/">HDHomerun Prime</a> (for cable TV), an Nvidia Shield 2, an Xbox One S, and an Apple TV. I use <a href="https://www.elac.com/series/debut-2-0/b6-2/?r=us">Elac Debut 2.0</a> bookshelf speakers here. In the living room there&rsquo;s a full Elac surround system paired with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hisense-100-inch-Ultra-Smart-100L10E/dp/B07NDGM8GF">Hisense 100&quot; short throw projector and screen</a>.</p>
<p>My preferred wired headphones to use with this system are the <a href="https://www.hifiman.com/products/detail/167">HiFiMan HE-560s</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>I recently upgraded my home network to <a href="https://ui.com">Ubiquiti</a> gear including the <a href="https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-routing-switching/products/udm-pro">UDM-Pro router</a>, a 48-port PoE switch, and five UniFi AC HD wireless access points connected to Comcast 1000/40 consumer Internet. All the various media centers and computer workstations are hardwired with Ubiquiti PoE managed switches.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a wine closet in the office, which besides wine, houses a Synology DS1019+ 5-bay NAS with 32TB of storage. It runs a Plex server, along with the usual NAS facilities, including backup for the other computers in the house. The Synology syncs to a Synology DS1515+ NAS at the studio using Hyperbackup.</p>
<h3 id="studio-a">Studio A</h3>
<p>In Studio A at the TWiT Eastside Studios, where we shoot <em>This Week in Tech</em>, <em>MacBreak Weekly</em>, and <em>This Week in Google</em>, I use a Heil PR-40 mic and JH Audio in-ear monitors. The big computer in front of me is a 2019 <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/desktops-and-all-in-ones/ideacentre/yoga-a-series/Yoga-A940-27ICB/p/FFYGF900316">Lenovo A940 all-in-one</a> with an 8th Generation Intel® Core™ i7-8700 Processor with a 27&quot; 4K UHD (3840 x 2160) IPS display,  32 GB RAM, and a 256GB SSD. It&rsquo;s running Manjaro Linux with the Gnome desktop.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://wiki.twit.tv/wiki/TWiT_Eastside_Studio_FAQ">TWiT Wiki</a> has a fairly up-to-date description of the hardware we use to stream the shows. The short version is that we use multiple Canon Vixia consumer grade camcorders, switched with a <a href="https://newtek.com/twit">Newtek Tricaster 2 Elite</a>, streaming live to Twitch, Ustream, and YouTube Live  via an Amazon Elemental. The shows are recorded using decks from Sound Devices. Editors use Adobe Premiere on Dell Precision Workstations. Our audio uses Telos&rsquo;s Axia digital over ethernet.</p>
<h3 id="studio-b">Studio B</h3>
<p>Studio B at the TWiT Eastside Studios doubles as my office. I shoot <em>The Tech Guy</em> radio show there, along with <em>Windows Weekly</em> and <em>Security Now</em>. While on the air use a 2016 5K iMac desktop and a 2019 System 76 Darter Pro laptop with a 4.9 GHz i7-10510U CPU, 32 GB RAM and a 2 TB SSD running Manjaro Linux with Gnome.</p>
<p>When I need to record audio I use Twisted Wave on the iMac. My Heil PR-40 mic is connected, as it is at home, using a Blackmagic Designs MixPre-3. I&rsquo;m wearing <a href="https://www.akg.com/Headphones/Professional%20Headphones/K240-Studio.html">AKG K240 studio headphones</a>.</p>
<h3 id="transport">Transport</h3>
<p>When the weather&rsquo;s nice, I ride to work on a Radpower electric bike, the <a href="https://www.radpowerbikes.com/pages/ebikes">Rad City Step Thru</a>. We own two old-school Segways which we mostly ride for fun. I drive a leased 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E First Edition and love it. Lisa has a 2022 electric Mini Cooper. We really like electric vehicles. Maybe that&rsquo;s because we generate and store our own electricity with 60 solar panels on the roof and two Tesla Powerwall batteries. Our house is on a well and without electricity we have no water.</p>

<p>Our spirits will be assaulted in the coming months – by coarse and crude language, by open displays of violence, of privilege, and of unchecked power. We may feel as if we are occupied by a hostile force. This feeling will combine with our grief to weaken and exhaust us. We must hold onto the things that refresh our spirits – time with family, music, art, nature, hobbies, food. We must protect our core.</p>

			 <p>I created this site in the midst of a pandemic. Now two years later, it&rsquo;s over. Right?</p>
<p>Today mask mandates are lifted in our county and, despite <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/mask-mandates-can-people-stop-wearing-masks-covid-rcna14587">cowardly quibbling from the CDC</a>, most of the US. It seems the pandemic ends with a whimper, not a bang. Sunday&rsquo;s mostly-maskless Superbowl was the party we&rsquo;ve all been waiting for. And, yet, I&rsquo;m not exactly ready to celebrate. Personally, I&rsquo;m planning to tiptoe back, mask at the ready. I&rsquo;d love to make a pyre in the backyard to burn them all, but what if there&rsquo;s a new virulent variant? We still have Π Ρ Σ Τ Υ Φ Χ Ψ and Ω if we need them.</p>
<p>But, for now, I&rsquo;m willing to say Mission Accomplished. Good job everyone. Let&rsquo;s say a prayer for the nearly one million dead in the US, nearly six million worldwide (a chilling number) and get back to living. Save the remaining ivermectin for the horses, shall we?</p>
<p>Oh, and get your goldurn vaccine, will ya? For me? For all of us!</p>

			 <p>I pulled the trigger on a Monster Gaming Machine. I know it&rsquo;s crazy, but boys just want to have fun.</p>
<p>See I have a three-year-old iMac Pro, but it&rsquo;s getting flaky and I&rsquo;ve been eyeing my wife&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-ultrasharp-49-curved-monitor-u4919dw/apd/210-arnw/monitors-monitor-accessories">49&quot; monitor</a> for months.</p>

<p>Maxed out with a Ryzen 7 5800X, nVidia GTX 3080, 128GB RAM, and dual 2TB drives (1 m.2, 1 spinning).</p>
<p>I know I could save money and probably get something better by building my own or going to a custom gaming PC maker, but these components are hard to get and I figure Dell can get them faster than anyone else. Even so this baby doesn&rsquo;t ship &lsquo;til May.</p>
<p>And as long as I&rsquo;m going for a power rig, I might as well go all out with a <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/new-alienware-55-oled-gaming-monitor-aw5520qf/apd/210-auds/monitors-monitor-accessories">monster monitor</a>, right?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A 55-inch OLED monitor that&rsquo;s absurdly expensive. (It&rsquo;s basically a hi-res TV but it costs a lot more.)</p>
<p>I rationalize this crazy purchase because</p>
<ol>
<li>I believe in open source, and like Linux as much as I like macOS. Dell supports Linux pretty well. (No I don&rsquo;t plan on using Windows. Ick.)</li>
<li>I really need to get to know the new PC hardware. Specifically The AMD Ryzen and the new nVidia ray-tracing GPUs.</li>
<li>I can&rsquo;t get an Xbox Series X or Playstation 5 to save my life, but I really want to play something new.</li>
<li>and the real reason&hellip; <a href="https://www.valheimgame.com">Valheim</a> (it runs on Linux!)</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been saving up for something like this for some time. It&rsquo;s kind of the Ultimate Gaming Machine for 2021.</p>
<p>OK tell me I&rsquo;m a fool. I&rsquo;m ready to be roasted. Or you can come over and watch me play Valheim come May.</p>
<p>UPDATE: It has arrived. I&rsquo;ve been playing with it all day and it&rsquo;s so fast. Super happy with the purchase. Dual booting Windows 10 with Manjaro Linux and everything is working perfectly. I think I&rsquo;m in love.</p>
<p>UPDATE (4 years later): I&rsquo;m still playing Valheim, but now it&rsquo;s on an M4Pro Mac mini with the same monster monitor. As usual, the monitor outlived the computer.</p>

<p>When I arrived at Kaiser they threw me a curve. &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Would you like Moderna or Johnson &amp; Johnson?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; I chose Moderna for a variety of reasons, but mostly because I think the mRNA technology is very cool. The process was quick and nearly painless. Afterwards I hod to wait 15 minutes, just in case I had a bad reaction. I didn&rsquo;t. My arm hurts a bit today, but that&rsquo;s the extent of the side effects. I expect worse after the second shot, April 14.</p>

<p>They are also affordable, he added. The rapid tests can cost as little as $1 each and return results in 15 minutes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Best of all, &ldquo;testing half the population weekly with inexpensive, rapid-turnaround COVID-19 tests would drive the virus toward elimination within weeks.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>One of our hosts asked me for some talent coaching. This is how I responded.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’ll tell you what I do, but this is only what works for me. I don’t have any talent. I can&rsquo;t tell jokes. I can’t juggle. I&rsquo;m not sexy. So all I can do is try to be myself, be likable, and serve my audience. I’m always trying to get to the love that’s at the core of all human interactions. For me, connecting with the audience is to love and honor who they are. And connecting with the audience is my job. It’s what I strive to do every time I’m on the air.</p>
<p>I do very little prep these days - I should definitely do more but I’m lazy. Remember I’ve been on the radio for 43 years, and doing interviews since 1987, so everything I do is totally internalized and mostly unconscious. There’s no way I could pass it on to you, and you wouldn’t want me to if I could, since the essence of being good on the air is to be totally yourself. And, bad news, you can’t <em>pursue</em> being centered and authentic on the air. You can only relax into it. And that just takes practice. It took me 15 years before I was any good.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In interviews, I am naturally curious. That helps. Always pay attention like a hawk to what people are saying. They’ll tell you what they want to talk about. Make it a conversation, not a series of questions. I will sometimes think of a question or two ahead of time, just so I have something to fall back on, but generally, if you are really engaged in the conversation, the next question will come easily. Never be thinking of what you’re going to ask next; you’ll miss the cues your guest is giving you. The essence of great interviewing is to be a great listener. Engage in the conversation and let your natural curiosity direct you. Be very careful about trying to show what you know. I hear a lot of interviewers trying to be smart. It’s better to be dumb. That’s how you learn.</p>
<p>I think it is worth trying to be as honest and genuine as you can be at all times. People can sniff inauthenticity. There’s plenty of it on the airwaves, but I believe people want to see you as you are. That’s scary because there’s always the risk people won’t like you, but it’s better to be yourself than to try to appeal to people by putting on a false persona. If they don’t like you, so be it.</p>
<p>Be open, be kind, and always aim toward honesty. It’s hard enough in real life, and it’s even harder on-the-air because you can&rsquo;t see your audience. It’s easy to fall into the trap of being automatic. Always strive to be present and always ask yourself, “am I telling the truth?”</p>
<p>Studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre">improv</a> was useful. In improv the rule is always to respond to every prompt with &ldquo;yes, and&rdquo; - never block, never say no. In improv you learn to listen. You also learn how to center and relax even while your energy is soaring. When the mic comes on you&rsquo;re going to feel a rush of energy. Use it, don&rsquo;t let it run you. You want to get into a heightened state of awareness without becoming amped up. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a> calls it flow. You&rsquo;re always working to get into the flow state. Also, learn how to pronounce long last names.</p>
<p>This is all very meta advice. I don’t do “talent coaching.” Sometimes coaching is as simple as telling someone to say “you know” less, but I don’t like to operate at that level. You should do that yourself. Watch video and look for repetitive verbal crutches and tics. Practice reading until you can be fluent, even the first time you see something. I make little notes to myself about goals, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t interrupt,&rdquo; &ldquo;slow down,&rdquo; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t curse,&rdquo; etc. and then store them in the back of my mind. Practice one thing at a time. It’s good to work on technique, but you don’t want to become self-conscious.</p>
<p>It’s like learning to be a pro-basketball player. You can work on your skills, and I guess you have to, but nothing is going to sing until you can stop being self-conscious enough to flow. If you’re “working at it” on-the-air it shows. Never let them see you sweat. You don’t want to make your audience worry about you. You want them to feel like you’re supremely confident and in control. But if you’re not, and stuff is falling apart, don’t hide it, be honest. Don’t freak out, enjoy yourself. That’s another way to be in control: own what’s going on. Your audience always knows exactly what’s going on. Don’t cover up, own up.</p>
<p>Sometimes it all goes to hell. It happens to all of us. Don’t sweat it. Tomorrow is another show. Keep striving to connect with your audience, to be human, to be honest, to be vulnerable. Strip away the protective shell we all wear and be present. The best on-air talent is totally real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to study others and notice what works. I love to study veteran performers. I am always impressed with how calm and in command they are. They never strive to entertain, they just do. Think of the person you like best on the air. What makes them interesting? What makes you <em>like</em> them? Find that in yourself. Don’t be them, of course, be you, but it&rsquo;s normal to start out by imitating your heroes and develop your own style later. I was heavily influenced by David Letterman, and copied his mannerisms for a long time. Before that it was Don Imus. I liked them because they never seemed to be trying to please their audiences. They had a &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; attitude. My career didn&rsquo;t take off until I stopped trying so hard. You don&rsquo;t want to be smarmy or ingratiating. Be cool.</p>
<p>Always remember you are there to serve your audience. That’s where the humility comes from. They aren&rsquo;t here to listen to you; you are there to serve them. To keep them company. To inform. To entertain. To make their lives better. Even just to give them a little break from the day-to-day. You are performing a great service. Be grateful for the opportunity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s everything I know about being on-the-air. Now forget what I said and be yourself. Getting to perform for others is a great privilege. Enjoy it.</p>

<p>Ira Glass from <em>This American Life</em> has the definitive quote: &ldquo;All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Normally I wait until Spring to start complaining, but I&rsquo;ve gotten nothing else done this summer, so I&rsquo;m going to start the campaign early. End Daylight Saving Time!</p>
<p>The august <a href="https://aasm.org/american-academy-of-sleep-medicine-calls-for-elimination-of-daylight-saving-time/">Academy of Sleep Medicine</a> has finally proclaimed the truth.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>“Permanent, year-round standard time is the best choice to most closely match our circadian sleep-wake cycle,” said lead author Dr. M. Adeel Rishi, a pulmonology, sleep medicine and critical care specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and vice chair of the AASM Public Safety Committee. “Daylight saving time results in more darkness in the morning and more light in the evening, disrupting the body’s natural rhythm.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The AASM position statement on daylight saving time has been endorsed by the following organizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>American Academy of Cardiovascular Sleep Medicine</li>
<li>American Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine</li>
<li>American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST)</li>

			 <p>Two updates: Looks like mastodon.network has folder, and quitter.no is going away in September. So I&rsquo;m moving my GNU.social account to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@leolaporte">mastodon.social/@leolapor&hellip;</a></p>
<p>&hellip;and&hellip;</p>
<p>in association with that I&rsquo;m using Keybase.io as an identity proof for all my online streams:</p>

			 <p>Lately I feel like Twitter and its users are suffering from some sort of mass psychosis. It&rsquo;s all id - to use a Freudian term. And it&rsquo;s communicable. I&rsquo;ve seen normal rational people descend into madness tweet by tweet. I&rsquo;ve felt it happen to me. Why? Is it the format that breeds this? Does that mean it would happen here? Or is it format + critical mass, like a petri dish? Could this medium breed generosity and kindness instead of rage and agression? What do you think?</p>

			 <p>Y&rsquo;know. I was all excited about the Samsung Galaxy S8+, but after using it for a couple of weeks I think I&rsquo;m going back to the Pixel. Still, nothing beats pure Android. And the camera is actually better on the Pixel.</p>
